Succumbed with darkness,&nbsp; the only bit of light is coming from the creeks in the door. As you move, the clanging of metal echoes out into the room. The room is reeking of a foul stench, mainly from the pool in the middle of the room.<br /><br /></p>\n</section>\n<p><br />The room itself isn't large, plates and corpses are to be seen, even the roof seems to crumble a little bit, but is sturdy enough to hold everything up. In the middle of the room is a pool of corpses, rusty shackles and bones filling the floor. The water itself is a green goo almost as thick as slime. Don't let the pipes fool you, they are blocked off so no water is actually circulating.</p>\n<h2>The Room</h2>\n<p>Their essential weapons are taken and brought to @JournalEntry[q0GpdYinNPbDUkcZ]{3 - The Butcher} . You choose what they can keep, if anything. The players themselves should essentially not remember how they got here, but some might remember they were invited to a nobel family, to dine and discuss some favours they would give, for the players help.<br /><br />The players should be shackled to the wall, to a single chain going around the hall. The players are stuck to each-other, and can't move more than 10ft away from the 1-2 other people they are chained to.&nbsp;<br />The chain itself is magical, alongside the shackles. It needs a mayor fire-spell to be broken apart, such as a fireball.</p>\n<p>The chain is hooked 2 places in the wall, one in each north corner. The plugs in the wall are old and rusty, a DC 15 Strenght check would pull them out of the wall.<br /><br />A DC 17 sleight of hand check can also be made to get loose from the shackles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The door is unlocked and fairly easy to open.</p>"}
